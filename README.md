This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to assist security professionals with activities related to Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, and Red Teaming. The tools provided aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security assessments, enabling testers to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess security risks, and simulate attack scenarios.

These scripts are intended for use by experienced professionals who understand the ethical and legal implications of performing security testing. They are specifically designed for authorised security testing and should not be used against systems or networks without explicit permission.

The repository maintainers explicitly disclaim any responsibility for misuse or unlawful actions carried out with these scripts.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have written consent from relevant parties before performing any penetration testing or security assessments. The maintainers do not support or condone any illegal activity, and any use of these tools for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited.
