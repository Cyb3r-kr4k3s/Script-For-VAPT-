Install Dependencies Script

To install these packages using `pip`, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


`pip install subprocess re argparse requests tabulate colorama pyfiglet termcolor`

However, please note that not all of these packages need to be installed via `pip`. The `subprocess`, `re`, and `argparse` modules are part of the Python standard library, which means they come pre-installed with Python and don't need to be installed separately.

So, the final command will be:


`pip install requests tabulate colorama pyfiglet termcolor`

Just copy and paste this into your terminal or command prompt, and it should install the necessary packages for you.
